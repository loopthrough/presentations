* Hello Gophers

* Why talking about Golang for web development

There are several questions to ask, among others:

- Is langauge mature and will it stand the future.
- Is it providing means to achieve what is needed.
- Is it promoting good engineering habits and culture.
- Can I motivate great engineers to work with it and how hard is to find them.
- How supportive is community
- ...

Importance of these depends on your particular case.

* About Go

- Released 2009, now in version 1.8
- Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson / C, Unix, UTF-8, HotSpot JVM
- Meant to replace C++
- Affecting Python/Ruby more in practice.

* Basic principles

- simplicity/conservativism, somewhat towards extreme
- Safer than C, kept on the low level of abstraction
- First-class higher-level concurrency primitives
- Pragmatism
- Designed for scaling both your product and the team

* Engineering culture
- Simplicity
- Pragmatism
- Explicit handling of errors.
- Testing, benchmarking.
- Composability instead of monolythin approach.

* Outstanding features

* Simple and effective type system
- statically typed
- type inference
- value construction literals
- structured typing
- can escape type system with "interface{}"
- too simple? No generics is a running complain since release.

* Type inference

.play type_inference.go

* Structured typing

.play structured_typing.go

* Concurrency primitives / CSP
- goroutines, lightweight threads on top of native OS threads.
- share memory by communicating, don't communicate by sharing memory.
- blocking/buffered typed channels for communicating and synchronisation.

* Channels example

.play channels.go

* Concurrency is not parallelism
- If execution will be parallel depends on many things.
- Go scheduler improves constantly for multicore execution.
- It is still on you to design your work chunks and distribute them properly.

* Compilation
- compiles to static binary, great for containers.
- compiles fast.
- runs fast as well.

* Langauge Tooling
- gocode
- goimport
- godef
- gofmt
- golint
- ...

* IDEs
- Emacs
- vim
- Visual Studio Code
- JetBrains Gogland
- ...

* Go and Web Development

* It is a good all-around tool
- Command-line tools
- Server-side rendering HTML
- Great for APIs
- microservices

* Comes with production ready HTTP server (net/http)
- Simple but powerful API for handling HTTP requests
- Concurrent, goroutine per request.
- Supports HTTP/2

.play http_server.go

* Using HTTP server API
- Easy to extend through middlewares

.code middleware.go

- Number of web frameworks built on top
- Still lot of teams just use provided API with different libraries.

* Comes with templating (text/template, html/template)
- simple but powerful
- text/template and html/template
- escaping by default
- live updates in DEV mode

* Template example

.link https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#example_Template

* Comes with testing and benchmarking frameworks (testing)
- simple to start testing your packages

* DB support
- Generic interface around SQL (database/sql)
- MySQL, Postgres, SQLite drivers
- Lot of drivers listed on Aswesome Go list: https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#database-drivers
- I used personally MongoDB driver.
- Some ORMs emerging

* 2016 Survey results

.link https://blog.golang.org/survey2016-results

* At the end
- Extremely easy to pick up, beware though of complex concepts behind
- Scales with the team, and is built for scaling your product.
- Oriented towards custom, not run-off-the-mill projects.
- Community valuing simplicity and pragmatism and getting things shipped.
- Can be annoying with the decisions taken for you.
- Package management improved but many find it lacking.
